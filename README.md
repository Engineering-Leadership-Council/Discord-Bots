## Installation & Setup

These bots are designed to run as a **Systemd Service** on a Raspberry Pi or Ubuntu server, ensuring they start on boot and restart automatically if they crash.

### Prerequisites
*   Python 3.8+
*   Git
*   A Discord Bot Token (from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications))

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Engineering-Leadership-Council/Discord-Bots.git
cd Discord-Bots
```

### 2. Run the Setup Script
We provide interactive scripts that handle dependency installation, `.env` creation, and service setup.

**Make scripts executable:**
```bash
chmod +x scripts/setup_main.sh scripts/setup_fork.sh
```

**Choose your setup mode:**

| Option | Command | Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Standard** | `./scripts/setup_main.sh` | For the main ELC Server deployment. |
| **Fork/Custom** | `./scripts/setup_fork.sh` | For devs or other orgs using a fork. |

**The script will:**
1.  Install Python requirements from `requirements.txt`.
2.  Help you configure the `.env` file with your tokens.
3.  Install and start the `discord-bots` systemd service.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables (`.env`)
The bot relies on a `.env` file for secrets and channel IDs.
*(See `.env.example` for the full template)*

```ini
# Tokens
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_token_here

# Channel IDs (Enable Developer Mode in Discord to copy IDs)
EVENT_CHANNEL_ID=123456789
WELCOME_CHANNEL_ID=123456789
GENERAL_CHANNEL_ID=123456789
INTRODUCTIONS_CHANNEL_ID=123456789
MAKER_GENERAL_CHANNEL_ID=123456789

# Role IDs
MEMBER_ROLE_ID=123456789
AUTO_JOIN_ROLE_ID=123456789
```

### Feature Toggles (`bot_config.py`)
You can easily enable or disable specific bots by editing `bot_config.py`:

```python
ENABLE_ROLE_BOT = True
ENABLE_WELCOME_BOT = True
ENABLE_EVENT_BOT = True

# Branding
ROLE_BOT_NICKNAME = "Sudo Master"
EVENT_BOT_NICKNAME = "The Event Loop"

# Welcome Messages
WELCOME_PUNS = [...] # Add your own puns here!
```

## Management & Updates

### Auto-Update System
The service is configured to **automatically pull the latest code** from GitHub every time it restarts. To update the bots, simply push to the `main` branch and then restart the service on the Pi.

### Service Commands
Control the bot service using standard systemctl commands:

```bash
# Check Status
sudo systemctl status discord-bots

# Restart (Triggers Update)
sudo systemctl restart discord-bots

# Stop
sudo systemctl stop discord-bots

# View Logs
journalctl -u discord-bots -f
```
