# Discord Bots

This repository houses custom Discord bots for the **Engineering Leadership Council (ELC)**.

## Features

*   **Jeff the Doorman (Welcome Bot)**:
    *   Targets specific welcome channels securely.
    *   Greets new members with random Engineering Puns (Electrical/Mechanical).
    *   Displays a "Where to Start" guide linking to key channels.
    *   Uses vibrant, randomized embed colors.
    *   **Anti-Spam**: Prevents duplicate welcomes via a 10-second debounce.

*   **Sudo Master (Role Manager)**:
    *   **Self-Service Roles**: Interactive dropdown menu for Affiliate Clubs.
    *   **Admin Setup**: Deploy the menu to any channel using `!setup_clubs #channel`.
    *   **Reaction Roles**: Create custom role messages with `!setup_reaction #channel "Title" @Role1 @Role2`.
    *   **Toggle Logic**: Clicking a role adds it; clicking again removes it.
