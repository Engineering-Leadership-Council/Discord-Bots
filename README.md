# ELC Discord Bots

**Professional Automation for the Engineering Leadership Council**

This repository hosts a suite of custom-built Discord bots designed to automate community management, streamline event scheduling, and enhance member onboarding. Built with `discord.py`, these services are optimized for reliability and ease of use on Raspberry Pi and Linux environments.

### 4. The G-Code Guardian (Stream Bot)
**Status:** `Active` | **Prefix:** `None`

Streams MJPEG video from local network sources to a Discord channel. Supports multiple concurrent streams with automatic recovery and status indicators.

#### **Key Features:**
*   **Multi-Stream Support:** Configure up to 5 streams via `.env`.
*   **Printer Status Integration:** Automatically fetches and displays real-time 3D printer status:
    *   **Supports:** Moonraker/Klipper (Standard) & **Elegoo SDCP** (Centauri Carbon).
    *   **Displays:** Filename, Print Progress (%), Elapsed Time, and Estimated Time Left.
    *   **Idle State:** Shows clean placeholders (`--`) when the printer is not active.
*   **Smart Recovery:** Automatically attempts to reconnect if a stream goes offline (e.g., printer power cycle).
*   **Wake-on-Connect:** Mimics a browser connection to force "lazy" cameras to start streaming immediately.
*   **Persistence:** Reuses existing stream messages on restart to prevent channel clutter.

#### **Configuration (.env):**
1.  Add `STREAM_BOT_TOKEN`.
2.  Set `STREAM_CHANNEL_ID` to the channel where streams should appear.
3.  Configure streams using the pattern `STREAM_X_...` and optional `PRINTER_X_...`:

```ini
STREAM_BOT_TOKEN=...
STREAM_CHANNEL_ID=123456789 (Developer Mode -> Copy ID)

# --- Printer 1 (Standard Klipper) ---
STREAM_1_URL=http://192.168.1.101:8080/video
STREAM_1_TITLE=Bambu Lab X1C
# Optional: Explicitly set printer API URL (defaults to http://<stream_ip>:7125)
PRINTER_1_URL=http://192.168.1.101:7125

# --- Printer 2 (Elegoo / SDCP) ---
STREAM_2_URL=http://192.168.1.102:8080/stream
STREAM_2_TITLE=Elegoo Centauri
# SDCP uses port 3030 over WebSocket
PRINTER_2_URL=ws://192.168.1.102:3030/websocket
```

#### **Commands:**
*   `!restart_streams` - **Admin Only** - **Purges the last 100 messages** in the stream channel and forces a clean restart of all stream tasks. Use this if streams get stuck or de-synced.

## Installation & Setup

These bots are designed to run as a **Systemd Service** on a Raspberry Pi or Ubuntu server, ensuring they start on boot and restart automatically if they crash.

### Prerequisites
*   Python 3.8+
*   Git
*   A Discord Bot Token (from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications))

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Engineering-Leadership-Council/Discord-Bots.git
cd Discord-Bots
```


### 2. Run the Setup Script
We provide interactive scripts that handle dependency installation, `.env` creation, and service setup. We also provide standalone scripts to run each bot individually for development or testing.

**Make scripts executable:**
```bash
chmod +x scripts/setup_main.sh scripts/setup_fork.sh scripts/run_*.py
```

**Choose your setup mode:**

| Option | Command | Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Standard** | `./scripts/setup_main.sh` | For the main ELC Server deployment. |
| **Fork/Custom** | `./scripts/setup_fork.sh` | For devs or other orgs using a fork. |

**The script will:**
1.  Install Python requirements from `requirements.txt`.
2.  Help you configure the `.env` file with your tokens.
3.  Install and start the `discord-bots` systemd service.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables (`.env`)
The bot relies on a `.env` file for secrets and channel IDs.
*(See `.env.example` for the full template)*

```ini
# Tokens
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_token_here

# Channel IDs (Enable Developer Mode in Discord to copy IDs)
EVENT_CHANNEL_ID=123456789
WELCOME_CHANNEL_ID=123456789
GENERAL_CHANNEL_ID=123456789
INTRODUCTIONS_CHANNEL_ID=123456789
MAKER_GENERAL_CHANNEL_ID=123456789

# Role IDs
MEMBER_ROLE_ID=123456789
AUTO_JOIN_ROLE_ID=123456789

# Schedule Bot
SCHEDULE_BOT_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

### Feature Toggles (`bot_config.py`)
You can easily enable or disable specific bots by editing `bot_config.py`:

```python
ENABLE_ROLE_BOT = True
ENABLE_WELCOME_BOT = True
ENABLE_EVENT_BOT = True

# Branding
ROLE_BOT_NICKNAME = "Sudo Master"
EVENT_BOT_NICKNAME = "The Event Loop"
STREAM_BOT_NICKNAME = "The G-Code Guardian"
SCHEDULE_BOT_NICKNAME = "The Timekeeper"

# Welcome Messages
WELCOME_PUNS = [...] # Add your own puns here!
```

## Management & Updates

### Auto-Update System
The service is configured to **automatically pull the latest code** from GitHub every time it restarts. To update the bots, simply push to the `main` branch and then restart the service on the Pi.

### Service Commands
Control the bot service using standard systemctl commands:

```bash
# Check Status
sudo systemctl status discord-bots

# Restart (Triggers Update)
sudo systemctl restart discord-bots

# Stop
sudo systemctl stop discord-bots

# View Logs
journalctl -u discord-bots -f
```
